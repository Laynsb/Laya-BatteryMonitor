=== Laya BatteryMonitor Service ===
# Developed By @Laynsb on telegram
# Inspired by @kaminarich (battery honey developer)
# Don't forgot to give me a small credit to appreciate my works üòÅ

# Dynamic feature toggle
‚Ä¢> debug.laya.battmon_enabled=1 (default) means thread process is running
‚Ä¢> debug.laya.battmon_enabled=0 means thread process is temporary terminated and goes into sleep mode

# How to Implement Laya Batterymonitor into my vendor?
Step 1: Place vendor.laya.battmon@1.x-service binary to /vendor/bin/hw/
Step 2: Place init.laya_battmon.rc to /vendor/etc/init/
Step 3: Patch vendor sepolicy cil (ask developer or do it by yourself)
Step 4: Done, you're great to repack your own vendor.

# Required context:
‚Ä¢ /vendor/bin/hw/vendor.laya.battmon@1.x-service > u:object_r:vendor_file:s0
‚Ä¢ /vendor/etc/init/init.laya_battmon.rc > u:object_r:vendor_configs_file:s0

=== Sepolicy Rules ===

üìù Not all rom has the same denials list, if crashing, error, or acting abnormally then resolve other denials on your own.

## Laya battmon denials list:
(allow init vendor_file (file (execute execute_no_trans)))
(allow toolbox init (fifo_file (write getattr)))

‚ö†Ô∏è In case if battmon crashing, include this policy:
(allow init init_tmpfs (file (execute)))
