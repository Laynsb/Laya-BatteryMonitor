# How to Implement Laya Batterymonitor into my vendor?
Step 1: Place vendor.laya.battmon@1.x-service binary to /vendor/bin/hw/
Step 2: Place init.laya_battmon.rc to /vendor/etc/init/
Step 3: Patch vendor sepolicy cil (ask developer or do it by yourself)
Step 4: Done, you're great to repack your own vendor.

# Required context:
• /vendor/bin/hw/vendor.laya.battmon@1.x-service > u:object_r:vendor_file:s0
• /vendor/etc/init/init.laya_battmon.rc > u:object_r:vendor_configs_file:s0

# Laya battmon denials list:
(allow init vendor_file (file (execute execute_no_trans)))
(allow toolbox init (fifo_file (write getattr)))
