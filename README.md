# Laya-BatteryMonitor Introduction (Rust)

Laya-BatteryMonitor is a very lightweight and zero-overhead daemon service for Android ROMs. It minimizes power usage by adjusting the CPU frequency and governor based on the screen state.

## Description

- Locks CPU frequency to minimum & Governor to powersave when the screen is off.
- Restores All CPU settings when the screen is turned on.
- Runs natively via OS's init and doesn't need a magisk module

## Installation

For installation and integration steps, refer to `guide.txt`.

## Core Behavior

â€¢ Smart CPU Policy Handling
Dynamically manages CPU frequency and governor behavior based on screen state changes. Fully adaptive to any device configuration.

â€¢ No dumpsys, No Bloat
Avoids Android's heavyweight system utilities (dumpsys, top, etc.) for efficiency. Instead, uses direct low-level file access and event monitoring via native sysfs interfaces.

â€¢ Event-Driven Power Saving
Monitors screen state using efficient inotify hooks to avoid polling and wakeups. Automatically applies power-saving CPU settings when the screen turns off, and restores the last-used performance state on wake.

â€¢ Microsecond-Class Efficiency
Written in a low-overhead systems language (Rust), focused on thread safety, zero-cost abstraction, and fast execution.

â€¢ Modular & Headless
No UI or frontend required. Designed for ROM integration. Can run silently in background with optional property toggling.
